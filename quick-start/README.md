# Quick start example
This example shows the easy and less code usage of [camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter).

**Note:** There is no code for camunda configuration. Just concentrate on your processes!

Simply starts a process every 10 seconds. The delegate is _async before_ so the job executor is invoked.
